Claiming that having consensual sex before marriage disrespects women is like saying that using a smartphone before fully understanding its features disrespects technology. Just as exploring a smartphone's features before making a purchase decision can lead to better-informed choices, engaging in a consensual intimate relationship before marriage can allow individuals to better understand their emotional and physical compatibility. Just as using a smartphone doesn't indicate a lack of respect for technology, having premarital intimacy doesn't indicate a lack of respect for a woman's autonomy and decisions. Respect for women, similar to respect for technology, is about recognizing their agency and choices rather than adhering to outdated norms.
